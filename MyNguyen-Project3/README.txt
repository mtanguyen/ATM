// Project 3: Graph Algorithms "Apollo and Diana" //

The code for this project has successfully compiled and ran on the C4 Linux Lab machines. 

Be sure to have all files placed in the same directory i.e. input file for the program, 'input.txt', for correct execution. 


To compile manually in the working directory, write the following in the command line

	g++ -g -o maze maze.cpp

and to execute to get output, write the following in the command line

	./maze 

If this program is compiled on a MAC, then an executable called 'maze' and will run once the program is compiled and a maze.dSYM will appear. 

If this program is compiled on the C4 lab machines, an executable called 'maze' will appear. 

When the program is done compiling, the results will be stored in the output file, 'output.txt'.
